# Simple Mathematical Functions

## About
This project includes all the python programs that I wrote that can be used to solve (mathematical) real world problems. When I was doing university projects, in most cases I was not allowed to use packages such as NumPy and Matplotlib. Hence I am curious as to how one solves such mathematical problems without the help of these packages and therefore I started to code and experiment, trying to use my mathematical knowledge and my current python skills along the way. Some of these algorithms I wrote in my free time and others I wrote as programming assignments for the module "Computerorientierte Mathematik I+II" at TU Berlin. Below I added a short description to each program. Please note that even though these algorithms run correctly (if you see a mistake, please let me know!), it is not guaranteed that they have optimal running time. 

## Code Description (in alphabetical order)

### savings.py
There are two subroutines here. **`total_savings`** gives you the amount of money you have after you saved it for `time` years, starting with $`starting_saving` and yearly saving $`yearly_savings` with `interest`%. you can specifically know how much money you have after `year` years
