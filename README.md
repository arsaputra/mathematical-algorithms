# Simple Mathematical Functions

## About
This project includes all the python programs that I wrote in my free time that can be used to solve (mathematical) real world problems. When I was doing university projects, in most cases I was not allowed to use packages such as NumPy and Matplotlib. Hence I am curious as to how one solves such mathematical problems without the help of these packages and therefore I started to code and experiment, trying to use my mathematical knowledge and my current python skills along the way. Below I added a short description to each program. Please note that even though these algorithms run correctly (if you see a mistake, please let me know!), it is not guaranteed that they have optimal running time.
